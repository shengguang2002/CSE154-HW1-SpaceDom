          <p>
            There are more stars in our universe than grains of sand in all of Earth's deserts
            and on all of its beaches. There are more than 200 billion stars in the Milky
            Way galaxy alone, 10% of which are similar to the Sun. Nearly a fifth of those
            Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized plant in the "habitable zone", meaning there are
            an estimated 4 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy. That number balloons to
            40 billion if you include planets orbiting red dwarfs. The closest one? That would
            be Proxima Centauri b, which orbits the closest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri,
            a mere 4.2 light-years away. If you were traveling at the speed of the
            fastest-moving manmade object (the Parker Solar Probe), an amazing 68.6 km/s,
            it would still take 18,500 years to get there. So close, yet so far.

        <h2>Far Out Facts</h2>
        <p>
          There are far too many interesting facts about space than humanly possible to list.
          However, we have chosen a few as can be seen below. To learn a lot more, you could always

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "The fact that the universe is expanding, as discovered by the Hubble telescope,
            tells us that we are on an insignificant speck in the center of an infinite universe.
            It's a very exciting prospect because it gives us a completely different perspective
            on our place in the cosmos."
          </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "The spectacle of the universe inspires in us a sense of our own smallness,
            but also a sense of our greatness."

        <h2>Three reasons to care about Space</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Navigation</strong>
            Exploring space is as necessary as discovering new continents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Curiosity</strong>
            People are naturally curious about the unknown and hope to understand the origin,
            nature, and laws of the universe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Innovation</strong>
            Space exploration requires advanced technology and equipment,
            driving technological progress and innovation.
          </li>
